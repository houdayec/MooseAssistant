What is it ?
-----------

MOOSE is an application developed to help students coming in Finland. Most of the time, it’s hard to find all what they need at the same place. They rather have to visit multiple websites to get a piece of information each time (rent, university, courses …). So we decided to concentrate all the most important content in one application, and give access to unique features as well.

Technical aspects
-----------
- Use of Navigation Drawer and Preferences.
- Navigation drawer will contain three parts : Info, Search / Events, Map.
  - Info : use of CardViews, Recycler Views and TabLayout + ViewPager
  - Search / Events : CardViews, Recycler Views and TabLayout + ViewPager, AsyncTask + Linked Events API provided by HRI (open source)
  - Map : current location + GM API

Development
-----------
The application is developed in Android.
